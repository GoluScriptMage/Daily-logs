🧠 What I Learned Today

[x] Understood and implemented email verification logic using backend tokens and secure routes.

[x] Little insights on how to structure async flow cleanly in Node.js.


💻 What I Built / Practiced

Completed backend setup for email verification flow 🔐

Continued work on the auth routes in the expense tracker project.


🔍 Issues or Doubts

Still refining the structure of reusable routes and middlewares — want it to feel clean and readable.


🔥 Realizations / Reflections

> Even with low energy days, a small push towards progress still counts. 50 mins today is a solid win when it could’ve been zero 💪✨



🛠 Tomorrow’s Plan

Start adding frontend connection to the email verification endpoint.

Revise JWT flow for login–signup pipeline once more.


🎧 Music I Coded With

No loud beats today — silent focus and occasional background anime OST 👀🎧


Note for Tomorrow myself

Don’t overthink the size of the step. Just keep showing up. Clean code and clean reps — same rule 🔄
