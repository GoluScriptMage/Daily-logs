🧠 What I Learned Today

No new tech today, but learned one thing from anime: Power without respect turns to arrogance. Respect builds true strength.


💻 What I Built / Practiced

Worked a little on the expense tracker routes — mostly maintained streak, no big additions.


🔍 Issues or Doubts

Not much confusion, just need to revise the auth logic in code again tomorrow to solidify.


🔥 Realizations / Reflections

Sometimes watching something great (like Kingdom) reminds me why I'm building — for the power to lead, not just follow.


🛠 Tomorrow’s Plan

Continue backend auth properly and revisit the push workout with focus. NO anime till 9 PM.


🎧 Music I Coded With

No music today — battlefield theme of Kingdom was playing in the back of my head 😂⚔️


💬 Note for Tomorrow Me

Discipline doesn't mean zero fun, it means knowing when to stop. Let's earn the anime next time, not binge it 😌
