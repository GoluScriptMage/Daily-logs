🧠 What I Learned Today

Today I didn’t learn any big new concept, but explored more in routing and authentication while building the expense tracker.


💻 What I Built / Practiced

Added authentication logic and made progress on routes for the expense tracker project.


🔍 Issues or Doubts

No major doubts today — smooth sailing!


🔥 Realizations / Reflections

Even on low-focus days, the streak matters. A little progress still moves you forward. Just showing up counts.


🛠 Tomorrow’s Plan

Clean up the auth logic, test protected routes, and maybe work on the frontend flow.


🎧 Music I Coded With

No specific music today — brain was half in anime mode 😅


📝 Note for Tomorrow Myself

You promised yourself to watch Kingdom after the grind. Don’t break that trust. Work first, anime reward baad mein 😌🔥


⏱ TIME

— Around 2 hours of study and coding combined — not the deepest, but still showed up.
