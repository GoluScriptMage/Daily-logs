## 🧠 What I Learned Today

- [ ] I learned today using firebase SDK
- [ ] Solved error that comes on using SDK get and post
- [ ] Practiced the get and post with custom hooks
- [ ] I also learned how can child element in get can give error

## 💻 What I Built / Practiced

- Created custom Hooks for get and post SDK ✅
- Integrated the methods to do multiple and single get post requests.
- Folder i praticed on --> "C:\Users\total\OneDrive\Desktop\React- Projects\React-meal"

## 🔍 Issues or Doubts

- Struggled too much while solving error with get post SDK
- Want to use MongoDb firebase feels complicated than mongodb 
- Didn’t get time to complete the get post to get and post data (planned for tomorrow)

## 🔥 Realizations / Reflections

> Felt little frustated but yeah i did study didm't let it make the excuse. .  
> I think I’m becone dumb **a child element can waste 3 hours 🥹 ""** 😌

## 🛠 Tomorrow’s Plan

- Completet this shit as faster possible
- Start learning MongoDb to connect in frontend (if time permits)
- Stretch session (recovering leg) and also started Shadow Boxing
- Just did the leg movements for today

## 🎧 Music I Coded With

- Naam Kaam – Akash Kaushal
- Since Tum – JANI

## Note for Tomorrow myself

- What i did today is study i feel little down bcz i studied 7-8 hours but actual thing i learned 3-4 hour more time wasted on error and solving stuff 😕 

## TIME

-- AROUND ^ 8 HOURS ^ -- :)
