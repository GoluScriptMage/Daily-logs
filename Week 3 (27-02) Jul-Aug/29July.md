## 🧠 What I Learned Today

- [ ] Today i didn't learn anything new, but the topics I learned earlier I learned new things about them or something that I didn't know before.

## 💻 What I Built / Practiced

- I am currently working on the expense calculator app, and today I implemented the auth routes.

## 🔍 Issues or Doubts

- I have tons of doubts but i solved them using copilot.

## 🔥 Realizations / Reflections

> Why regretting over something that i done than i have full control over it and I can change the things now.

## 🛠 Tomorrow’s Plan

- Continue working on the expense tracker app and complete it
- And learn more about the google based authentication and implement it in the app.

## 🎧 Music I Coded With
