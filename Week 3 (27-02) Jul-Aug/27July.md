## 🧠 What I Learned Today

- [ ] Nothing new learned just one thing that then we are defining the global error handle using
      `app.use(errorHandler)` in the app.js file, it should be defined after all the routes and the all routes should be defined before it.

## 💻 What I Built / Practiced

- I practiced the error handling and the crud operations in the expense calculator app using express and mongoose.

## 🔍 Issues or Doubts

- No doubts faced today.

## 🔥 Realizations / Reflections

> Today my head by paining a lot, so I was not able to do much work. But I learned that it's important to take breaks and rest when needed. And at least I was able to study 40 min and now I am going to sleep early.

## 🛠 Tomorrow’s Plan

- Continue working on the expense calculator app and implement more features.

## 🎧 Music I Coded With

- Nothin

## Note for Tomorrow myself

- Today i have not done much yesterday i didn't much and the day before yesterday too and i will not blame anyone or the excuses but the yesterday was busy and today and yesterday both day i have exam too today my head was paining a lot so i was not able to do much work
