## 🔥 Realizations / Reflections

> I realized that in the coding it is not just about the hours u write the code but about even in which condition u are writing the code showing up even then u have the excuse of resting or not doing it, even the time i am coding for a few days not too much or leanrning too new things but one thing for sure i am showing up everyday and that is most important thing. It is more than 20+ days i am showing up and coding everyday and that is the most important thing for me.
