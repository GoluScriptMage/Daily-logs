🧠 What I Learned Today

[ ] Not much today, just thought deeply about the new project flow and structure

[ ] Realized I need to understand my own components more clearly


💻 What I Built / Practiced

Renamed the new project to Emotional Mirror

Tweaked some question wordings

No major commits but still stayed connected to the project mentally


🔍 Issues or Doubts

Styling still confuses me sometimes 🫠

Too many components, hard to remember what’s where


🔥 Realizations / Reflections

> Some days won’t be productive — but discipline is still showing up, even with 10% energy. That counts.



🛠 Tomorrow’s Plan

Focus on understanding one or two component structures properly

Maybe write custom buttons or cards using Copilot as base

Rest well so tomorrow feels sharper


🎧 Music I Coded With

No major coding, but NEFFEX “Destiny” still runs in the back of my head 🖤


Note for Tomorrow myself

Tu weak nahi hai — today was rest mode, tomorrow is bounce-back mode. Bas dikh ja.


TIME

-- Around 20–30 min of light work, mostly planning and renaming --
