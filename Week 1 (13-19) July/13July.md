- Created a mini registration form using `useReducer` ✅

## 🔍 Issues or Doubts

- Struggled a bit with reducer switch logic

- Didn’t get time to connect backend (planned for tomorrow)

## 🔥 Realizations / Reflections

> Felt super fast today. Did in 1 hour what used to take 3+ before.

## 🛠 Tomorrow’s Plan

- Integrate backend with form (Node.js + MongoDB)
- Start learning Context API (if time permits)
- Stretch session (recovering leg)
