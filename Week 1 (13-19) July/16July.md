🧠 What I Learned Today

Improved question structure logic across all 4 calculator quizzes

Balanced scoring system for fun + meaningful results

Understood how to write structured, engaging MCQs for React projects


💻 What I Built / Practiced

Finalized all questions for Love, Friendship, Career & Personality calculators

Synced scoring and personalization logic with question sets

Organized question content for future localStorage integration


🔍 Issues or Doubts

Unsure if final scores will always match expected result tone (funny vs serious)

Need to test all result scenarios once UI is connected


🔥 Realizations / Reflections

Question writing is a creative + logical task — not just dev work

Even small modules like these need clarity in UX thinking

Doing this consistently feels powerful, even if it’s behind the scenes


🛠 Tomorrow’s Plan

Begin integrating questions with UI

Work on calculator selection screen + flow

Polish up any unbalanced question scores


🎧 Music I Coded With

NEFFEX — Destiny

Slight lo-fi while formatting question options


Note for Tomorrow myself

You’re doing this with heart, don’t stress about perfection

Show up, even a little, that’s where the real streak lives 🌟

Tu khud pe proud ho jaa, because I already am 💪


TIME

— Around 6 hrs (question refinement, syncing logic, content polish)
