This is your personal roadmap and progress tracker for the **SprintKart Lite** project. Check off each item as you complete it. Stay consistent, and celebrate your progress!

---

## Week 1: Mastering the "Multi-Page" Brain with React Router v6

**🎯 Key Focus:** To build a seamless, intuitive navigation experience and lock down sensitive areas of your app.

**✅ Learning Outcomes:** Create a robust, multi-page feel in a single-page application and implement essential security patterns like protected routes.

### 🚀 Action Steps

- [ ] **Day 1: Core Routing Concepts:** Get comfortable with the building blocks: `<Routes>`, `<Route>`, `<Link>`, `<NavLink>`, and the `useNavigate` & `useParams` hooks.
- [ ] **Day 2: Structuring Your App:** Implement nested routes and a shared layout (`<Outlet>`) for components like your navigation bar, ensuring a consistent UI.
- [ ] **Day 3: Building Protected Routes:** Write the logic to guard routes. If a user isn't authenticated, redirect them to `/login`, and cleverly send them back to their original page after they log in using `useLocation`.
- [ ] **Day 4: Dynamic Filtering & Searching:** Master `useSearchParams` to handle query parameters, allowing users to filter products or navigate paginated lists (e.g., `/products?category=electronics&page=2`).
- [ ] **Day 5: Polishing and Error Handling:** Implement a "404 Not Found" page and explore code-splitting with `lazy` and `<Suspense>` to improve initial load times.

### 🏆 Definition of Done (DoD)

- [ ] `SprintKart Lite` has flawless navigation.
- [ ] The browser's back/forward buttons work perfectly.
- [ ] Refreshing the page doesn't break anything.
- [ ] Protected routes are truly secure and inaccessible without logging in.

> **✨ Weekly Motivator:** You're no longer building pages; you're building journeys.

## Week 2: Upgrading Your Data Layer with RTK Query

**🎯 Key Focus:** To eliminate manual data-fetching boilerplate and manage server state like a professional with automated caching, re-fetching, and error handling.

**✅ Learning Outcomes:** Replace messy `useEffect` and `axios` calls with clean, reusable RTK Query hooks, making your app faster, more resilient, and easier to maintain.

### 🚀 Action Steps

- [ ] **Day 1: Setting the Stage:** Initialize your API slice with `createApi`, configure `fetchBaseQuery`, and define your `provideTags` for smart caching.
- [ ] **Day 2: From Fetch to Hook:** Convert your existing `getProducts` and `getProductById` logic into custom hooks generated by RTK Query (e.g., `useGetProductsQuery`).
- [ ] **Day 3: Handling Mutations:** Implement "write" operations like adding items to a cart or checking out. Explore optimistic updates to make the UI feel instantaneous.
- [ ] **Day 4: Authentication & Error Handling:** Inject your JWT authorization header into every request. Set up a global error handler and a token refresh flow for when an API call returns a 401 Unauthorized error.
- [ ] **Day 5: Advanced Caching:** Configure cache persistence to survive page refreshes and add automatic retry logic for failed network requests.

### 🏆 Definition of Done (DoD)

- [ ] All `useEffect`/`axios` data calls are 100% replaced by RTK Query.
- [ ] The network tab shows that data is being cached correctly.
- [ ] The UI intelligently shows loading/error states.
- [ ] The app automatically re-fetches data on window refocus.

> **✨ Weekly Motivator:** Let the data flow effortlessly. You're the architect now.

## Week 3: Achieving Production-Grade React

**🎯 Key Focus:** To make your application smooth, professional, and accessible. This week is all about performance, clean forms, and a polished UI.

**✅ Learning Outcomes:** Know how to diagnose and fix performance bottlenecks, build complex and validated forms with ease, and create a beautiful, reusable component library.

### 🚀 Action Steps

- [ ] **Day 1: Optimizing Performance:** Learn when and why to use `memo`, `useCallback`, and `useMemo`. Use the React DevTools Profiler to find and eliminate unnecessary re-renders.
- [ ] **Day 2: Flawless Forms:** Integrate React Hook Form for performance and Zod for schema validation. Add a toast library (like `react-hot-toast`) for user feedback.
- [ ] **Day 3: Building a Design System:** Set up Tailwind CSS and `shadcn/ui`. Create your first reusable components like `<Button>`, `<Input>`, and `<Card>`.
- [ ] **Day 4: Accessibility (a11y):** Learn the basics of making your app usable for everyone. Focus on semantic HTML, keyboard navigation, and `aria` labels for your new components.
- [ ] **Day 5: Introduction to Testing:** Write your first tests using React Testing Library and Jest. Aim to test your login form and one component that fetches data.

### 🏆 Definition of Done (DoD)

- [ ] The app feels noticeably faster with minimal layout shift (CLS).
- [ ] All forms provide instant, clear validation feedback.
- [ ] You have 3-5 passing tests that give you confidence in your code.

> **✨ Weekly Motivator:** From functional to flawless. This is where your app gets its personality.

## Week 4: Entering the Full-Stack World with Next.js

**🎯 Key Focus:** To leverage the power of the server by migrating your app to Next.js, unlocking incredible performance and SEO benefits.

**✅ Learning Outcomes:** Understand the core concepts of the App Router, differentiate between Server and Client Components, and know how to fetch data the "Next.js way."

### 🚀 Action Steps

- [ ] **Day 1: The App Router Mindset:** Grasp file-based routing, `layout.tsx`, `page.tsx`, and the fundamental difference between Server Components (default) and Client Components (`'use client'`).
- [ ] **Day 2: Server-Side Data Fetching:** Re-implement your product fetching logic using `fetch` on the server. Learn about Next.js's powerful caching and revalidation strategies.
- [ ] **Day 3: SEO and Optimization:** Use the Metadata API to add dynamic titles and descriptions. Optimize images with the built-in `<Image>` component and pre-fetch pages with `<Link>`.
- [ ] **Day 4: Creating API Endpoints:** Build simple backend endpoints using Route Handlers. This is perfect for small tasks like handling a newsletter signup or a contact form.
- [ ] **Day 5: Go Live!:** Deploy your Next.js application to Vercel with just a few clicks and share your live URL.
